                   <p> For the titles and headlines of my project I have chosen typeface 'Amatic SC'. Why? It's readable and catchy - 2 of the best qualities needed in the Mobile Website.<br>
      <br>
         
         For all bodytext is used 'Nanum Gothic'. Very simple, very useful. I have personal prejudice for any 'serif' fonts, that's why I don't think any of them would be ever seen in my projects.

         The typefaces described are the ones used on the Website - Google font source - not in the Project Document!

          <p>For me it was very hard to come up with a good logo. Naturaly, the plan was to create something connected with Cubism, but I was extremely divided between following Picasso and making it personal. 
          As you can probably see from my many attempts..
          <br>In the end I made sort of compromise between those two.</p>
          
          <p>Probably the first thing you had in your mind was 'WHY PIG?!'. 
             It means couple of things to me, but only positive ones! Just found them very loving and wonderful creatures. Despite common faith they're also surprisingly intelligent.<br>
              
              And easy to draw in geometrical version!<br>
              
    <br>
              To create the logo was used Illustrator and its geometrical tools partly filled with different pink hue for ears and nose area.
